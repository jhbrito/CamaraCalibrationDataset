# Camara Calibration Dataset

Jos√© Henrique Brito

This is a dataset with images of a calibration target, taken with a variety of different cameras, from DSLR, compact, GoPro, phone cameras and Raspberry Pi.
For the Cannon 6D, different lenses were used.

The calibration target is a 10x7 checkerboard printed on a flat vynil board. The physical size of each square is 26mm.

For each camera-lens pair 25 images were taken.
All images were taken in the same controlled lighting environment, with difuse lighting.
